PERSONAL TECHNICAL PORTFOLIO 
DOCUMENTATION
INTRODUCTION:
1.1OVERVIEW:
 
 The Personal Technical Portfolio is a static web application designed to 
showcase an individual's technical skills, projects, achievements, and 
experience in a visually appealing and organized manner. It aims to highlight 
their expertise, demonstrate their coding abilities, and provide a 
comprehensive understanding of their technical background to potential 
employers, clients, or collaborators. The goal of this application is to create a 
visually compelling and professional portfolio that impresses visitors and 
establishes a strong online presence.
Technical Architecture
PURPOSE:
While there are innumerable benefits to launching your online portfolio, a few 
stand out from the rest. These benefits might be exactly what you’re looking 
for if you’re in the middle of a job hunt, are coming up on graduation, or are 
considering a competitive career.
LITERATURE SURVEY
2.1 Existing Problems:
In this post, we provide a simple checklist of common portfolio mistakes, and 
how to fix them, quickly and easily. You might also want to check out 
these excellent design portfolio examples and be sure to display your portfolio 
on the best ultrawide monitor, too.
01. Addressing the wrong audience
When you first launch a portfolio website, your first feedback comes from family, friends 
and co-workers. So there’s always a natural impulse, conscious or subconscious, to fashion 
something that these particular people will go ‘wow!’ at.
But that’s not the audience you need to be worrying about. You need to consider what a 
potential client or employer will be looking for and how they’ll be viewing your portfolio, 
which will usually be completely different from a friend or colleague. The former, for 
instance, will probably spend a long time looking at different aspects of your site; the latter 
will be seeking much more specific information, much faster.Once you start thinking along 
these lines, what you need to include on your portfolio site and how you organise it 
becomes a lot clearer.
02. Too much work on show
You’re proud of everything you’ve done, and people want to see as much of your work as 
possible, right? Wrong.
Potential clients and employers don’t wish to spend ages trawling through your back 
catalogue until they find something they like. They’re more likely to glance at one or two 
pieces, and make a snap decision. So you need to be ruthless in selecting only your absolute 
best work and putting it front and centre.
While people are willing to rummage for cheap items at a jumble sale, when you enter a 
high-end store you see much smaller collection of carefully curated items. Apply the same 
logic to your portfolio site and you won’t go far wrong.
.
03. Lack of context
There’s no point in just posting visuals by themselves, with no explanation of the context for 
which they were created.
Let’s return to our potential client or employer. Ask yourself: what will they want to know? 
At the very least, probably a combination of the following: When was the work created? 
How was it created? Is this entirely your work, or a collaboration (in which case, who else 
was involved, and what part did you play?). What was the brief? Was the client happy? 
What was the timeline? What elements of the project are not shown here?
That’s the bare minimum you need, but it doesn’t hurt to provide more. Remember in 
maths at school when you were told not just to give the answer, but “show your working”? 
That’s a good rule to apply to portfolio sites too.
So if it’s possible (check with the client first!), consider writing a full case study, including 
notes on the design process; early sketches; rejected concepts and designs, and so forth.
04. Too little work on show
While including too many examples of your work is the most common portfolio mistake, 
designers at the beginning of their careers can often make the opposite mistake: showing 
too little.
Put simply, if the Work section of your website is too sparsely populated, it doesn’t give a 
great impression. Not had enough commissioned work? Then there’s nothing wrong with 
posting student projects, as long as you clearly explain what the brief was and how you 
fulfilled it.
Don’t have enough student projects? Then just do some designs of your own, label them as 
‘personal projects’, and again, explain the thinking behind them.
Real-world commercial work is always preferable of course, but demonstrating that you can 
deliver something to a brief, even an imaginary one, is much better than leaving a blank 
space.
05. Vague and incomplete personal informat
As well as providing information about the work itself, you also need to provide a clear 
explanation of who you are and what you do, normally in an ‘About Me’ section.
There’s a current trend to just add a ‘snappy’ or ‘witty’ tagline under the designer’s name, 
something like “Designer of things for money”. You might be able to get away with this if 
you’re extremely well known, but if not, this is a massive turn-off for clients or employers.
Another common portfolio crime is making your contact details hard to find, or even nonexistent. Again, if you’re a world-famous designer then refusing to give an email and saying 
“The best place to find me is on Twitter" might be acceptable. For the rest of us, it’s not, so 
just provide a damn email address. 
06. A lack of purpose
Many portfolio websites avoid making the previous obvious mistakes but are still failures 
because it’s just not clear what they’re trying to achieve.
Often that’s because the designer doesn’t know themselves, beyond a general ‘well, you’ve 
got to have a website, haven’t you?’
But if you don’t think about what you want your website to achieve, how will you know if 
you’ve achieved it? So before you start, sit down to have a long, hard think about what your 
main goals are.
For instance, if you’re looking to get a job, have you made that clear? People are not 
telepathic so if you don’t say, people will assume you’re happy to remain a freelancer.
Alternatively, maybe you already have enough freelance work, but wouldn’t mind getting 
some better paid commissions? In which case, why not make your preferred rates clear, and 
avoid long email conversations with time-wasters who just want to lowball you?
Or perhaps you don’t want more work right now, but just want to steadily build up your 
name and reputation. In which case, you’ll want to think about including testimonials, press 
reviews and other ‘social proof’ to bolster your standing.
07. It doesn’t work on mobile
The best way for someone to view your portfolio is always going to be on a big, beautiful 
widescreen monitor. But you can’t guarantee that’s what will happen.
These days, it’s increasingly likely that potential clients and employers will be viewing your 
portfolio site on mobile devices. So you need to make sure it’s not going to look awful on a 
small screen.
Most importantly, can you view the images properly, or do they reduce down to tiny, 
formless thumbnails? If the answer to that question is yes, then your site is not fit for 
purpose.
08. It’s out of date
Once you’re happy with your portfolio site, don’t just ‘set it and forget it’.
Potential clients and employers may well look at your site a number of times over the 
course of a year. If nothing new is added, they may assume you’ve had no work. So think 
about how you can refresh the site on a regular basis. Could you add new work examples, 
refresh the design or maybe even add a blog?
Also, sign on with Google Analytics to find out how many people are visiting the site, and 
which bits they’re most interested in. Don’t jump to unwarranted conclusions, but do use 
this information to improve the site and its content, bit by bit, over time.

FUTURE SCOPE
The future scope of personal portfolio apps is vast. According to Investopedia, there are 
several mobile apps that offer real-time information on all your investments in a one-stop 
place . These apps can provide information on your investments from 401k (s) to IRAs. Some 
portfolio management apps can sync with your existing accounts, and most are free. Some 
of the most popular apps include Empower (formerly Personal Capital), SigFig Wealth 
Management, Sharesight, and Yahoo Finance .
In addition, DevTeam.Space suggests that you can build an investment portfolio app that 
offers features like that of “Personal Capital” . You can build a web, an Android, and an iOS 
app and support English-speaking users. You need to determine which features you will 
offer in your “Minimum Viable Product” (MVP), subsequently, you can enhance the app 
based on market feedback.
